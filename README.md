# 👋 Hey, Welcome to My Engineering Blog

I’m Shahsank Shekhar — a backend/system dev who’s been building stuff in the wild for almost a decade.  
My roots are in C++ (Qt, radios, embedded-ish chaos), but I’ve been branching out into distributed systems, Rust, Go, and whatever else helps ship better software.

No corporate fluff here — just practical engineering notes, experiments, and honest takes.

## 🚀 What This Blog Is About

This space is where I document the tech I’m exploring, breaking, and rewriting at 2AM.

Expect topics like:

- Systems design & low-level patterns  
- Rust (ownership brain-melts included)  
- Go for fast iteration & tooling  
- C++ war stories  
- Tooling: Cargo, Bazel, build systems  
- Distributed systems & networking  
- Debugging + profiling  
- Performance & observability  
- Deployment guides: [Steps to Deploy Frontend on AWS](./_posts/2026-01-08-deploy-frontend-aws.md)

Basically: **anything that helps build fast, reliable, “pls-don’t-wake-me-at-night” software.**

## 🦀 Rust Journey (One Chapter)

Rust isn’t the whole story — but it’s definitely a fun one.

I’m tracking:
- Migrating from C++ → Rust mindset
- Unsafe Rust & FFI playgrounds
- System-level problem-solving
- Design patterns, idiomatic takes, and anti-patterns
- Real issues I hit + how I fixed them
- When Rust shines vs when I just reach for Go instead

If you’re curious about Rust from a systems perspective, you’ll probably vibe.

## 🧠 Why I’m Doing This

Simple:  
I learn best when I explain.  
And I’m tired of keeping notebooks full of notes that no one else ever sees.

So this blog is:
- My tech brain dump
- A journal of experiments
- A place to share mistakes (so you don’t repeat them)
- Somewhere to rant when a compiler ruins my day

If any of that sounds like your jam, stick around.

## 🧩 Who This Blog Is For

- Engineers who like low-level work
- C++ folks looking sideways at Rust
- Go devs breaking into systems
- Anyone building large, high-perf services
- Curious people who love learning from real-world examples

If you care about clarity, correctness, and craft — you’ll fit in.
