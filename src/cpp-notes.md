> **💡 Quick Reference Guide**  
> These notes are designed as a **quick brush-up** for developers who already have a solid understanding of C++. Think of this as your **pre-interview cheat sheet**—concise reminders, key syntax, and common patterns. Not a tutorial, but a memory jogger for concepts you've seen before.
