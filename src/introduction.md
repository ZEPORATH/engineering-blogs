# 🚀 Shashank Shekhar's Engineering Blog

**Building reliable systems at scale, one deep-dive at a time.**

---

## 👋 About Me

I'm **Shashank Shekhar**, a seasoned backend and systems engineer with nearly a decade of experience shipping production software in demanding environments. My journey spans from low-level C++ systems (Qt, embedded devices, radio systems) to modern distributed architectures.

**Core Expertise:**
- **Systems Programming**: C++, Rust, Go
- **Distributed Systems**: Design, scaling, reliability
- **Performance Engineering**: Profiling, optimization, observability
- **Infrastructure**: Cloud deployment, DevOps, automation

I'm passionate about writing software that **actually works** in production—not just in tutorials.

## 🎯 What You'll Find Here

This blog is my digital workshop where I document real engineering challenges, solutions, and insights. No marketing fluff, just practical knowledge from building systems that handle real load.

### Core Topics

#### **Systems Architecture & Design**
- [Real-Time vs Non-Real-Time Systems](./real-time-systems.md) — Deep C++ & Linux analysis with working code
- Low-level system patterns and anti-patterns
- Performance-critical application design

#### **Programming Languages & Tools**
- **Rust**: Ownership battles, FFI adventures, systems programming
- **Go**: Fast iteration, tooling, microservices
- **C++**: War stories from production systems
- **Build Systems**: Cargo, Bazel, CMake, and modern tooling

#### **Distributed Systems & Infrastructure**
- Networking, consensus, fault tolerance
- Cloud architecture and deployment
- Observability and monitoring at scale

#### **Development Workflow & Tools**
- [Setting Up mdBook for Personal Blogging](./mdbook-setup.md) — Why I switched from Jekyll
- Debugging techniques and profiling
- Deployment automation: [AWS App Runner Guide](./aws-deployment.md)

## 🎉 Why Read This Blog?

Because most tech content is either:
- **Too basic** — "Hello World" tutorials that don't help production code
- **Too academic** — Theoretical concepts without real-world application
- **Too promotional** — Marketing disguised as technical content

**This blog bridges that gap** — practical, in-depth content from someone who's been in the trenches.

Ready to dive deep? Let's build something reliable.
